# PII patterns for redaction
# Copy this file to pii.yaml and fill in your values
#
# Each pattern is a PEG (Parsing Expression Grammar) using parsimonious syntax.
# The grammar must define a "match" rule as the entry point.
# Text is normalized (non-alphanumeric characters removed) before matching.

patterns:
  # Literal match - exact string (after normalization)
  - 'match = "123456789"'

  # SSN pattern - 9 consecutive digits
  - |
    match = d d d d d d d d d
    d = ~"[0-9]"

  # Account number with prefix
  - |
    match = "ACCT" d d d d d d
    d = ~"[0-9]"

  # Case-insensitive match using regex
  - 'match = ~"[Jj][Oo][Hh][Nn][Dd][Oo][Ee]"'

  # Partial match - last 4 digits of known number
  - 'match = "1234"'
